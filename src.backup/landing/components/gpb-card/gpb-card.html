    <p class="md-body-1">Urban and suburban areas, including many of America’s post-industrial cities, grapple with how to manage abandoned and vacant properties.  When these properties are deconstructed or demolished, vacant lots lie in their wake.  The Green Pattern Book, developed out of a grant from the US Foreast Service’s Northern Research Station to Baltimore City, is a tool to assist urban residents, administration, and community and nongovernmental organizations in “greening” these vacant lands and improving quality of life in the city.  The book presents eight green project types for vacant lots, depending upon circumstances including community preferences, land tenure, and available funding, and provides extensive design guidelines around site selection, site layout and implementation, permits and zoning, maintenance, and funding.  The Green Pattern Book is a robust tool for planning and implementing community greening initiatives throughout Baltimore, and is relevant to many other cities in America and beyond that are wrestling with problems stemming from vacant and abandoned properties.  The Green Registry extends the relevance and impact of the Green Pattern Book, by providing a central repository for mapping past, current, and potential greening efforts.  Most greening efforts are community-inspired, organized, and driven.  We hope you will be inspired to think about a greening effort in your neighborhood, and that you use the Green Pattern Book and Green Registry as tools in your effort to help Baltimore achieve a greener future!</p>
