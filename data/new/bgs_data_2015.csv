Notes from Glenda Weber, 11.13:
Patch 381 Pinewood & McClean

Description
Beautiful woods with many mature oaks/beech/tupelo. Moss and native wild flowers on the forest floor.  The soil in different places seems to be very wet. We were curious if there might be a water source (seep, spring, etc.). This has a track across the street and residents along the other 3 sides.  It is a square shaped lot that is owned by the city. There are paths through it in several places. There were many small tupelo/ Black Gum trees in places here. 

Possible Safety Concerns
