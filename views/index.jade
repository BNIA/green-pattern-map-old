               p
               b identified
               |– This status means that  a stormwater Best Management Practice (BMP) type has been identified for the location.  This identification may have been listed in a Watershed Assessment report, a Small Watershed Action Plan (SWAP), or a suggestion from the community.  Multiple BMPs and BMP types can be identified for one location.  The details of the BMP are still conceptual and feasibility for installation has not been determined.  Also, no organization has committed to installing the BMP, so it is available to use to meet regulatory requirements.    The resource will be the organization identifying the BMP and any  document which lists the BMP.  The identification number will be randomly assigned unless specified in the reference document.
               br
               p
               b Proposed
               |– This status means that the identified BMP has been determined to be feasible and an organization has made a commitment to install the BMP.  The proposal may have been a listing in a regulatory implementation plan (such as the City’s  MS4 WIP),  a strategy for environmental mitigation for development, or an approved grant funded project.   The resource will change to show the organization proposing the BMP and any  document which lists the BMP.  The  identification number will be changed to match the number used within the reference document.
               br
               p
               b Permitted
               |– This status means that the proposed BMP has  received final approval by  DPW for compliance with Article 7, Division II of the City Code and the Maryland Stormwater Management Design Guidelines. Specific technical details of the BMP, including the amount of impervious area restoration, are available and will be reported to MDE as part of the City’s Annual MS4 reporting.  Construction is anticipated to occur within 4 years of this status change to permitted.   The resource will remain the same as the proposed phase.   The identification number will be changed, as assigned by DPW and used in any regulatory reporting.
               br
               p
               b Active
               |– This status means that the permitted BMP has been constructed and is functioning. The responsible agency will be the organization that will be responsible for maintaining the BMP.  The identification number will remain the same and be used as a reference for any reporting on post-construction inspections or 3-1-1 service requests related to maintenance needs.  Note that the City will only perform maintenance if a City agency is listed as the responsible agency.
               br
               p
               b Inactive
               |– This status means that the active BMP is no longer in existence or that a study or evaluation has shown that an identified BMP is not feasible for construction.
